# nesdemo
This is some experiment that I did trying to learn Nes ASM development.

Now I can raymarch a sphere and put that on the PPU pattern table, so no predraw CHR files here.
Also it is using the sprite 0 hit for switching the table and paint almost 500 sprites in screen.

It is really slow, so you better use the turbo option in your emulator to get decent speed.
